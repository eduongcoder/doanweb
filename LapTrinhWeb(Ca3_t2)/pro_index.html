                    and was later released by Shueisha into 72 tankōbon volumes. The story revolves around Uzumaki Naruto,

                    based on two of Kishimoto's Yomikiri: Karakuri (1995), which helped Kishimoto win Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
                    Naruto was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump, Shueisha's magazine from 1999 to 2014, and was packaged in tankōbon with 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime series co-produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, with a total of 220 episodes broadcast in Japan from 2002 to 2007;

                    in 2006. Reviewed positively by critics for the manga's character development, strong plot, well-done fight scenes, 
                    although the fight scenes slow down the pace of the story. Experts also emphasize that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, uses cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.
